# unlam-crypto-nodechain

## Usage

You need to have `yarn` installed on your machine to start the project.

### Windows

On the base folder, run:

``` sh
yarn
```

and then run the `run-crypto-servers-and-client.bat` file. This opens three Nodechain server instances and starts the UI client.

### Mac
